<h1 align="center"> Hi! I'm Jesús Serrano (@Jesega), nice to meet you! 👋 </h1>
<h3 align="left"> I'm a Junior Software Developer looking forward to learn as much as possible! </h3>



I consider myself a passionate Software Developer who looks forward to work on software projects. You never know enough, so I like to  be in a continuous learning procedure. Currently I'm finishing my Computer Science Degree at University of Cadiz. I only have to present my end-of-degree project!

```python
while(true){
  learn()
}
```
